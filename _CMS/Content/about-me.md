Below you can find two sections.

The first section includes work-related information with the second including personal information so you can get to know me a littler better if youâ€™d like.

## Work

My JavaScript framework of choice is Vue.js, and I will almost always choose Nuxt.js to build my Vue application or site.

My experience ranges from using PHP WordPress to using building small desktop apps with Electron for my personal use.

Here is small list of dev related items that I use frequently and recommend:

- Nuxt.js
- Netlify
- Firebase
- Vercel (Formely Zeit)
- Sanity.io

I would call myself a Dev Junkie. I love learning about new tools, approaches, and technologies for everything related to web development.

Also, I am the creator of [Vue2Editor](https://github.com/davidroyer/vue2-editor), an open-source rich text editor plugin powered by Vue.js and Quill.js.

## Personal

I love learning new things. I do this by listening to podcasts, listening to
audiobooks and watching documentaries. Interesting topics and well-delivered
content are the only requirements but I tend to enjoy topics regarding history,
true crime, or technology.
